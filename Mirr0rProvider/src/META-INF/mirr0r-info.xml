The application provides a data to XML mapping facility. Simply associate you data columns to XML elements / attributes and then serialize to XML... Done!

Project works with few standards such as Dublin Core, OAI-PMH, SPECTRUM... If you need a specific schema to be developed ask us to do it. The Source is open so you can do it yourself if you want.
